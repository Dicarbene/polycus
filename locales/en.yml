  about-self:
    info: >-
      wxj hails from dongguan! He has earned degrees from the CUP university (a
      cup right?). Before finding a job (still finding), he participated
      competitive programming(not ending well), and play a few fun side hustle
      (too fun to be near productive). While his work focuses on frontend
      engineer, besides mostly getting frustrated by leetcode and bfe, his
      non-work interests range widely, everything from succulents and cats to
      pens and novels. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a
      “length-limited” about section!
